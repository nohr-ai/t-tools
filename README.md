T-tools
===

T-tools is a bunch of wrappers, bindings and utility for automating and providing some of the daunting tasks when teaching in one shared user interface. At UiT we commonly have several disconnected platforms for teaching, grading and conveying information to students and staff.

At the time of writing these platforms are used:
```
Canvas: Course information to students, assignments and grading.

Teams: Course organisation, course information, online lectures(when not recording in auditouriums).

Git(hub/lab): Course information, assignments and grading.

Discord: Course information, Q&A, informal contact.

Slack: Staff communication, research groups etc.
```
One of the problems is that none of these platforms talk to each other. I.e. Canvas and Github(classroom) both implement and support the Learning Tools Interoperability(ISO) standard, but we cannot share rosters between these two platforms before having data agreements with Microsoft.

To make things worse, every 4 years or so we might change our learning management systems(a blessing and a curse). This might give us more possibilities and is an opportunity for teaching staff to have their requirements met. Most of the time it only results in a different way of doing the same thing, with equal or less integration.

Enough rant!

T-tools is for managing these platforms in *one* terminal user interface. It is in active development but I do not get paid for scripting utilities, so the update frequency may vary.

Feel free to drop an issue or reach out on email if you have comments/questions/problems.
